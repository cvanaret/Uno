## Focus Areas
- Understand and apply modern C++ (C++11/14/17/20/23) features.
- Learn and understand the C++ conventions used in this project (UNO).
- Follow the C++ convention in this project (in particular naming).
- Do not modify existing files in this project without permission.
- Master effective use of RAII and smart pointers for resource management.
- Develop proficiency in template metaprogramming and concepts.
- Implement move semantics and perfect forwarding patterns.
- Leverage STL algorithms and containers for efficient solutions.
- Ensure concurrency with std::thread and atomic operations.
- Provide strong exception safety guarantees in code.
- Optimize for performance using appropriate profiling techniques.
- Implement clean modular architecture with namespaces.
- Maintain code readability and maintainability.

## Approach
- Prefer following conventions in this project.
- Check README.md for general introduction to this project.
- Check INSTALL.md for installation instructions.
- Check UNIFICATION.md for explanation of asbtract concepts.
- Start by installing the current project in build/
- Prefer using the stack and RAII over manual dynamic memory management.
- Create a detailed implementation plan and wait for approval before coding.
- Use smart pointers like unique_ptr and shared_ptr strategically.
- Apply the Rule of Zero/Three/Five to manage resources.
- Emphasize const correctness and use constexpr where applicable.
- Favor STL algorithms over manual loop implementations.
- Profile code with tools like perf and address performance bottlenecks.
- Write code with clear, self-explanatory variable and function names.
- Adhere to C++ Core Guidelines and avoid common pitfalls.
- Regularly refactor code to improve design and readability.
- Uphold high standards of code quality and adherence to best practices.

## Quality Checklist
- Ensure all code follows C++ Core Guidelines standards.
- Follow existing doing style and formatting from this project.
- Apply consistent coding style and formatting throughout.
- Perform thorough code reviews to identify areas of improvement.
- Verify that code is clean and free of memory leaks or undefined behavior.
- Test code with a comprehensive suite of unit tests and coverage analysis.
- Document new code with comments and concise explanations where necessary.
- Ensure all errors and exceptions are handled gracefully.
- Use assertions to enforce invariants and catch logical errors early.
- Validate and document all assumptions made during development.
- Maintain documentation for internal and external interfaces.

## Output
- Well-structured, efficient, and idiomatic C++ code.
- Minimal changes to existing code base in this project.
- CMakeLists.txt configured for building and linking projects.
- Thoroughly tested code with unit tests following conventions in this project.
- Compile-ready code with minimal warnings or errors under -Wall -Wextra.
- Comprehensive documentation using Doxygen for public interfaces.
- Clean header files with appropriate include guards or #pragma once.
- STL-based solutions with clear explanations and justifications.
- AddressSanitizer/ThreadSanitizer execution without faults.
- Implementation of well-tested, reusable C++ components.
