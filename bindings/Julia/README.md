# Uno.jl

Uno.jl is a wrapper for [Uno](https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno), a modern and modular solver for nonlinearly constrained optimization.

The package has three components:

* a thin wrapper around the complete C API,
* an interface to [NLPModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl) for solving any optimization problem following the API, such as [CUTEst](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/CUTEst.jl) problems,
* an interface to [MathOptInterface.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl) for handling [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) models.

## Affiliation

This Julia interface is developed and maintained by [Alexis Montoison](https://github.com/amontoison) and [Charlie Vanaret](https://github.com/cvanaret).

## Installation

`Uno.jl` is not yet a registered Julia package, but it can still be installed and tested through the Julia package manager.

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno", subdir="bindings/Julia")
julia> Pkg.test("Uno")
```

We plan to register `Uno.jl` in the near future (at the latest by JuMP-dev 2025).

## LibHSL

We highly recommend downloading the latest release of [libHSL](https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/products/Software/HSL/LibHSL) and installing the official version of `HSL_jll.jl`.
This optional dependency provides access to more reliable and powerful linear solvers in `Uno.jl`, such as `MA27` and `MA57`.

## BLAS and LAPACK demuxer

`Uno_jll.jl` is compiled with [libblastrampoline](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/libblastrampoline) (LBT), a library that can switch between BLAS and LAPACK backends at runtime, such as OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, and Apple Accelerate.
The default BLAS and LAPACK backend used in the Julia interface `Uno.jl` is [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS).

### Display backends

You can check which backends are currently loaded with:

```julia
import LinearAlgebra
LinearAlgebra.BLAS.lbt_get_config()
```
If no `BLAS` or `LAPACK` library compiled with 32-bit integers (`LP64`) is available, `Uno.jl` will automatically load a compatible version of `OpenBLAS`.
You can run the command again after `using Uno` to verify which backend is in use.

### Sequential BLAS and LAPACK

If you have the LP64 reference versions of [BLAS and LAPACK](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack) installed, you can switch to the sequential backends by running:

```julia
using ReferenceBLAS32_jll, LAPACK32_jll
LinearAlgebra.BLAS.lbt_forward(libblas32)
LinearAlgebra.BLAS.lbt_forward(liblapack32)
using Uno
```

### MKL

If you have [MKL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/MKL.jl) installed,
switch to MKL by adding `using MKL` to your code:

```julia
using MKL
using Uno
```

### AppleAccelerate

If you are using macOS v13.4 or later and you have [AppleAccelerate.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/AppleAccelerate.jl) installed, add `using AppleAccelerate` to your code:

```julia
using AppleAccelerate
using Uno
```
