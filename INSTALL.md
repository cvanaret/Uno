## Installation instructions

### Packages and libraries

* download the AMPL solver library (ASL): http://www.netlib.org/ampl/solvers/

* **(optional)** download  solvers:
    * BQPD (null-space active set solver for nonconvex quadratic programming): get a precompiled binary for your architecture (https://github.com/leyffer/BQPD_jll.jl/releases) or get in touch with Sven Leyffer to apply for an academic license (https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~leyffer/solvers.html)
    * MA57 (sparse indefinite symmetric linear solver): http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/catalogue/ma57.html
    * LIBHSL (collection of libraries for sparse linear systems): https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/products/Software/HSL/LibHSL
    * MUMPS (sparse indefinite symmetric linear solver): https://mumps-solver.org/index.php?page=dwnld
    * HiGHS (linear programming and convex quadratic programming solver): https://highs.dev

* to compile MUMPS in sequential mode, remove the flag `-fopenmp` at the end of your `Makefile.inc` and set the following variables:
```console
INCS = $(INCSEQ)
LIBS = $(LIBSEQ)
LIBSEQNEEDED = libseqneeded
```

* **(optional)** install BLAS and LAPACK:
```console
sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapack-dev
```
* install cmake (and optionally ccmake, CMake curses interface):
```console
sudo apt install cmake cmake-curses-gui
```

### Compilation

1. Create a `build` directory in the main directory and move to it:
```console
mkdir build && cd build
```
2. Execute cmake:  
```console
cmake [options] ..
```
You can pass the following options:
- build type: `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug]`
- build the Uno static library `uno_static`: `-DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=[ON|OFF]`
- build the Uno shared library `uno_shared`: `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[ON|OFF]`
- enable LAPACK: `-DWITH_LAPACK=[ON|OFF]`
- path to the BQPD library: `-DBQPD=path_to_bqpd_lib`
- path to the MA27 library: `-DMA57=path_to_MA27_lib`
- path to the MA57 library: `-DMA57=path_to_MA57_lib`
- path to ASL library: `-DAMPLSOLVER=path_to_amplsolver_lib`
- path to HiGHS install directory: `-DHIGHS_DIR=path_to_highs_install_dir`
- path to HSL library: `-DHSL=path_to_hsl_lib`
- path to METIS library (`fakemetis` is built with MA57): `-DMETIS=path_to_metis_lib`
- path to MUMPS library: `-DMUMPS_LIBRARY=path_to_mumps_lib`
- path to MUMPS common library: `-DMUMPS_COMMON_LIBRARY=path_to_mumps_common_lib`
- path to MUMPS PORD library: `-DMUMPS_PORD_LIBRARY=path_to_mumps_pord_lib`
- path to MUMPS MPISEQ library: `-DMUMPS_MPISEQ_LIBRARY=path_to_mumps_mpiseq_lib`
- path to MUMPS include directory: `-DMUMPS_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_mumps_include_dir`

3. **(or)** Use ccmake to provide the paths to the required and optional libraries:
```console
ccmake ..
```
4. Compile (in parallel: `n` being the number of threads, e.g. 6):
```console
make -jn
```
5. Compile the ASL executable:
```console
make uno_ampl -jn
```

To compile the code with different configurations, simply create a `build` directory for each configuration and perform instructions 1 to 5.

### Install

6. Install the built libraries and executable (`uno_static`, `uno_shared`, and `uno_ampl`):
```console
sudo make install
```

### Unit tests

7. Install the GoogleTest suite:
```console
sudo apt install googletest
```
8. Compile the test suite:
```console
make run_unotest -jn
```
9. Run the test suite:
```console
./run_unotest
```

### Precompiled libraries and executables

We provide precompiled Uno libraries and executables in the [releases tab](https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno/releases/latest/) for Linux (x64 and aarch64), macOS (x64 and aarch64), and Windows (x64).

On some platforms, the dynamic linker needs to know where to look for libraries at runtime.
You might need to set the following environment variables:

- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux
- `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` on macOS
- `PATH` on Windows

These variables should include the directory where you extracted the library files.
For all platforms, the environment variable `PATH` is needed to locate the binary `uno_ampl` / `uno_ampl.exe`.

**Example for Linux**:
```console
tar -xzf Uno.vX.Y.Z.linux.tar.gz
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/extracted/Uno/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/path/to/extracted/Uno/bin:$PATH
```

Note: The shared library `libhsl.so` / `libhsl.dylib` / `libhsl.dll` provided in the precompiled archive is a dummy version that does not include the official HSL linear solvers such as `MA27` or `MA57`.
However, it can be safely replaced with the official precompiled [libHSL](https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/products/Software/HSL/LibHSL) library without the need to recompile anything.
The routine symbols are identical, allowing seamless hot-swapping of the library.
